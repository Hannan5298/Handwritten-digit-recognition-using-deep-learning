# Handwritten-digit-recognition-using-deep-learning
This is a Handwritten Digit Recognition Model is a deep learning artificial intelligence model that can recognize handwritten digits with a high degree of accuracy. The model has been built using the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks and is trained on a large dataset of handwritten digit images called MNIST. With an accuracy of over 98%, this model has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, from automated form processing to recognizing handwritten numbers on checks and other financial documents. The model is easy to use and can be integrated into other software systems for automated digit recognition.
